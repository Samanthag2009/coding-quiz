# Coding Quiz

This quiz allows you to sharpen your skills and test your knowledge. Can you beat your own score?

## Description

While still in development, this quiz functions on basic javascript features and html.

## Challenges and Successes

### Challenges

* The main holdup for this project was deciding to go a different route midway through development. In the beginning, this quiz was comprised of multiple functional HTML documents that referenced each other, triggered by button. Had I seen this through and commited to the initial design, I would have reached completion in a short amount of time. I switched gears to attempting to create the quiz on one page of HTML and ran behind significantly.

* The interval timer posed a challenge that I'm looking forward to solving on resubmition.

### Successes

This project was very helpful in practicing my CSS skills, and allowed me to work with visual effects such as gradients for an aesthatic experienc for our end user.

## To Do

* Make a firm decision on methods for completion and stick to it
* fix interval timer
* work with lcoal storage for the High Score page
* Create questions with event listeners
